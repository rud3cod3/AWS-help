* how to make it work 
- once you are done creating launch tempalate and auto scalling group go to auto scaling group
- go to "automatic scalling" section
- look for scheduled action > add your schedule
- we can use it for both scale up and scale down 
- to do it we need to create two seprate groups thats all we need to do
