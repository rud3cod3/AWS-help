* manual scaling with a launch template and Auto Scaling group means "scaling by explicitly setting desired EC2 instance count in the ASG yourself," leveraging the launch template for configuration but without automated scaling actions.

* Key Points :

- Manual scaling gives you direct control, but requires you to anticipate demand.
- Automation (using scaling policies) can be added on top of this setup, but is not used in manual scaling.
- The launch template provides repeatable, versioned instance configurations, making scale adjustments fast and consistent.

* How Launch Templates and Auto Scaling Groups Work Together
- Launch template: This defines all the details needed to launch EC2 instances (AMI, instance type, key pair, security groups, etc.). You set this up once, and your Auto Scaling group refers to it whenever it needs to launch instances.
- Auto Scaling group (ASG): This is a logical grouping of EC2 instances managed collectively. It uses your chosen launch template to provision new instances.

* When doing manual scaling, you:
- Create or update your launch template.
- Create an Auto Scaling group based on this template.
- Use the AWS Console, CLI, or API to set the "Desired Capacity" value—the specific number of instances you want running.
- The ASG will add or remove EC2 instances to match this desired value, but only when you tell it to—there are no automatic triggers (unless you later add scaling policies).
