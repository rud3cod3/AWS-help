* Create your launch template and auto scalling group
* This policy allows you how your auto scalling group replace instances during operations such as  
[1] Updating instance to newer version of AMI
[2] Replacing unhealthy instances identified by health-checks
[3] Maintaining desired capacity across the availibility zone

* To perform update process of ami 

- Go to launch instance > modify template > add new version ( 2 in my case ) > and select different ami such as ubuntu > done
- Auto scaling group > "your asg" > launch template > edit > change version to "2" > update
- Now go to auto scalling > instance refresh >	click on "start instance refresh" 
- We will have to choose policy for that and here is some info about those policies 

[1] Terminate and Launch
- Unhealthy instances are terminated immidiately, followed by new launches
- cost saving ( beacuse if 2 instance are running and you launch two more than you terminate currently running 2 it will cost slightly more depending on the instance)
- To set this policy choose launch template > details > instance maintanance policy > edit > update
- Now when you go to Instance refresh you will find it there > change instance warm up time to 60 and click on start instance refresh

[2] Launch before termination
- In a way launch 2 instances and then kill the old 2 instances 
- kinda costs more

[3] Custome policy
- depends how we use how we customize
