* AWS Dynamic Scaling: Complete and Corrected Notes

1.Overview
- Dynamic Scaling:
  Automatically adjusts EC2 instance count based on changing demand, driven by monitored metrics (typically via Amazon CloudWatch).  
  Requires CloudWatch for all monitoring and triggers.

- Pre-requisites:  
  - Create a Launch Template (providing consistent instance configuration)
  - Create an Auto Scaling Group using the template
  - Configure instance user data script as desired
  - Once instances are launched, access the ASG’s "Automatic Scaling" section and select "Dynamic Scaling" policies

2. Dynamic Scaling Policy Types

1.Simple Scaling
- How it works:  
  Uses a single CloudWatch alarm to trigger scaling.
- Example:  
  If *CPU utilization >50–60%*, add 1 instance.
- Key Points:  
  - Threshold-based: Easy to configure.
  - Uses CloudWatch alarms to monitor metrics and trigger scaling.
  - Only one scaling action occurs per alarm breach; not ideal for rapid demand shifts.

2.Step Scaling (Multiple Thresholds)
- How it works:  
  Supports multiple thresholds and scaling adjustments depending on metric levels.
- Example: 
  - If *CPU utilization 50–60%*, add 1 instance
  - If *CPU utilization 60–70%*, add 2 instances
  - If *CPU utilization 70–90%*, add 3 instances
- Key Points:  
  - Provides granular control for scaling based on the severity of metric breach.
  - Useful when application load increases incrementally—a more flexible approach.

3.Target Tracking Scaling
- How it works:
  Automatically maintains a target metric (e.g., average CPU utilization) by adjusting capacity as needed.
- Example:  
  - Set target CPU utilization to 50%. ASG will automatically scale out or in to keep the average as close as possible to 50%.
- Key Points:  
  - Self-optimizing, minimal manual intervention; set your target and AWS manages instance count.
  - Ideal for consistent, predictable performance optimization.
  - No need for explicit CloudWatch alarm configuration—target tracking uses pre-defined policies.

3. Configuration Workflow

1. Create Launch Template (for instance settings)
2. Create Auto Scaling Group
3. (Optional) Add user data scripts for bootstrapping instances
4. Configure Dynamic Scaling:
   - Go to ASG > Automatic Scaling > Dynamic Scaling Policies
   - Choose policy type: Simple, Step, or Target Tracking
   - Set up necessary CloudWatch alarms (for simple or step scaling)
   - Define thresholds, instance adjustments, or target value

Summary Table

| Policy Type              | Trigger Mechanism         | Scaling Adjustment         | Use Case                          |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Simple Scaling           | Single CloudWatch alarm  | Fixed number of instances | Basic, straightforward scaling    |
| Step Scaling             | Multiple thresholds      | Varying instance count    | Flexible, responds to load levels |
| Target Tracking Scaling  | Desired target metric    | Automatic                 | Hands-off, continuous optimization|

Key Point
- *CloudWatch* is required for metric monitoring and trigger setup—dynamic scaling won’t work without it.
- Choose scaling policy based on workload patterns and operational goals:
  - Simple Scaling for predictable, easy-to-manage scenarios
  - Step Scaling for nuanced control in more complex environments
  - Target Tracking for hands-free self-optimization
