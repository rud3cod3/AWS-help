* For this type of scalling you have 3 options

1. simple scalling
2. step scalling
3. target tracking scalling

* if we want to use dynamic scalling we need cloudwatch without that it wont work

* for to make it possible

- create launch template
- create auto scaling group 
- use this user data script
- after instance finish launching
- go to ASG and "automatic scaling" section and look for "Dynamic Scalling Group"
- in here we will get policy types

[1] Simple scalling
- here you can set simple threshold- means if cpu utilization is more than 50 - 60 %  than we can add one more instance
- here we need to use cloudwatch alarm

[2] Multiple threshold / step scaling
- Multiple threshold
- we can add one instance if cpu utilization is between 50 to 60%
- we can add two instance if cpu utilization is between 60 to 70%
- we can add three instance if cpu utilization is between 70 to 90%

[3] Target tracking scalling
- It's automatic
- Set the value and that's done
- Self optimization
