Amazon Route 53 — The Ultimate Comprehensive Guide

1. What is Amazon Route 53?

* Route 53 is AWS’s scalable and highly available Domain Name System (DNS) web service.
* It translates domain names (like example.com) into IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1).
* Supports domain registration, DNS routing, health checks, and traffic management.
* Fully managed, global DNS service with 100% SLA.
* Works with both **public hosted zones** (internet DNS) and **private hosted zones** (VPC-internal DNS).


2. Hosted Zones: Core DNS Containers

* A hosted zone is a container for DNS records for a specific domain or subdomain.
* Two types:

  * Public Hosted Zone:  DNS records accessible globally on the internet.
  * Private Hosted Zone:  DNS records accessible only inside one or more specified VPCs.

* Each hosted zone has a unique **Hosted Zone ID** (like Z1234567890ABC) used for API/CLI calls.
* When you create a hosted zone, AWS automatically creates NS and SOA records.


3. DNS Records in Route 53 — Detailed Breakdown

| Record Type                  | Purpose                                                         | Route 53 Details & Use Cases                                                           | Example                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **A** (Address)              | Maps a domain to an IPv4 address                                | Use with IP addresses or use Alias records for AWS resources to avoid cost and latency | `example.com A 192.0.2.1`                                    |
| **AAAA**                     | Maps a domain to an IPv6 address                                | Same as A record but for IPv6                                                          | `example.com AAAA 2001:db8::1`                               |
| **CNAME**                    | Alias for another domain name                                   | Cannot be used on apex/root domain (example.com). Only subdomains (like www)           | `www.example.com CNAME example.com`                          |
| **MX** (Mail Exchange)       | Specifies mail server for domain                                | Priority value, lower = higher priority. Used for routing emails                       | `example.com MX 10 mail.example.com`                         |
| **TXT**                      | Arbitrary text data                                             | Commonly used for SPF, DKIM, domain verification                                       | `example.com TXT "v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all"`      |
| **NS** (Name Server)         | Specifies authoritative DNS servers for the domain or subdomain | Created automatically, for delegating subdomains too                                   | `example.com NS ns-123.awsdns-45.net`                        |
| **SRV** (Service locator)    | Defines services, ports, protocols                              | Used in SIP, LDAP, XMPP, etc.                                                          | `_sip._tcp.example.com SRV 10 60 5060 sipserver.example.com` |
| **SOA** (Start of Authority) | Indicates the start of the zone and authoritative info          | Auto-created, controls zone refresh, retry, expiry times                               | -                                                            |

## 4. Alias Records — AWS’s Special DNS Feature

* Alias records let you point your domain directly to AWS resources (CloudFront, ELB/ALB, S3 static website, API Gateway, VPC endpoints).
* Benefits:

  * No additional DNS query charges for alias queries.
  * Can be used on apex/root domain (unlike CNAME).
  * AWS automatically handles the IP addresses behind the resource.
* Must use AWS resource’s **Hosted Zone ID** with the alias record.
* Example: Point `example.com` to ALB DNS `my-alb-123456789.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com`.

## 5. Routing Policies Explained

Route 53 supports different routing policies to control how DNS queries are answered.

| Policy                        | Description                                                                        | Use Case & Behavior                                |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Simple Routing**            | Basic DNS lookup, returns single resource                                          | When you have one IP or hostname for the domain    |
| **Weighted Routing**          | Distributes traffic among resources by assigned weights                            | Blue/green deployments, A/B testing                |
| **Latency Routing**           | Routes users to region with lowest latency                                         | Global apps with multi-region setups               |
| **Failover Routing**          | Routes traffic to primary or secondary (failover) endpoints based on health checks | High availability setups                           |
| **Geolocation Routing**       | Routes traffic based on user’s geographic location                                 | Regional content delivery or legal compliance      |
| **Geo-proximity Routing**     | Routes based on distance from user, with optional bias adjustment                  | Complex geographic traffic control                 |
| **Multivalue Answer Routing** | Returns multiple healthy IPs in response (like DNS round-robin)                    | Basic load balancing without Elastic Load Balancer |

---

## 6. Health Checks & Failover Setup

* Route 53 health checks monitor endpoint availability and performance via:

  * HTTP, HTTPS, or TCP checks.
  * Can check status codes, response time thresholds.
* Health checks integrate with failover routing policies.
* **Health check costs: 

  * Approx. \$0.50 per health check per month.
  * Plus small query charges when health checks are in use.
* You can create CloudWatch alarms on health check failures for notifications.

## 7. Pricing Details and Cost Optimization

| Cost Item        | Pricing                                    | Notes                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hosted Zone      | \$0.50 per month per hosted zone           | Applies whether or not you use it actively              |
| DNS Queries      | \$0.40 per million queries after free tier | Free tier offers 1 billion queries/month for first year |
| Health Checks    | \$0.50 per health check per month          | Charged separately from hosted zone/query fees          |
| Traffic Policies | Additional costs apply                     | If you use Route 53 Traffic Flow advanced features      |

**Cost Optimization Tips: 

* Use **Alias records** to avoid extra query costs.
* Keep hosted zones only for active domains.
* Use private hosted zones for internal AWS traffic to avoid external DNS queries.
* Monitor query volume to identify unusual spikes.

## 8. AWS-Specific Quirks & Best Practices

* **Alias records** vs. **CNAME**:

  * Use alias for AWS resources and apex domains.
  * CNAME not allowed at apex domain level.
* **TTL (Time to Live): 

  * Minimum TTL in Route 53 is 0 seconds, but practical TTLs should be higher (30s to 300s typical).
  * Short TTL helps rapid failover, but increases query volume.
* **Private hosted zones**:

  * Associate with multiple VPCs.
  * Supports cross-account associations (requires permissions).
* **NS Records**:

  * When delegating subdomains, update parent zone NS records carefully.
* **API Rate Limits**:

  * AWS Route 53 APIs have rate limits — avoid rapid massive changes in short time.
* **DNSSEC**:

  * Supports domain signing to prevent DNS spoofing.
* **Route 53 Resolver**:

  * Allows DNS queries between on-prem and VPC via forwarding rules.
