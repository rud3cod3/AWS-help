* AWS Manual Scaling with Launch Templates and Auto Scaling Groups

1.Manual Scaling: What is It?
- Definition:
  Manual scaling means directly controlling the number of EC2 instances in your Auto Scaling Group (ASG) by explicitly setting the "Desired Capacity" yourself.  
  It uses a launch template for consistent, versioned instance settings, but does NOT use automated scaling policies (like dynamic or scheduled scaling).

2.Key Characteristics
- Direct Control:  
  You decide when to add or remove instances by manually adjusting the desired capacity.
- No Automated Actions:  
  Unlike dynamic or scheduled scaling, thereâ€™s no automatic response to traffic spikes, CPU, or other metrics.
- Launch Template Value:  
  By defining a launch template, you gain:
  - Consistent configuration of all new instances.
  - Easy scale adjustments using repeatable settings (AMI, instance type, etc.).
- Manual Effort:  
  You must monitor demand and make scaling decisions yourself; risk of under- or over-provisioning if demand changes unexpectedly.

3. How Launch Templates and ASGs Work Together
- Launch Template:  
  Contains all configuration details for EC2 instances (AMI, instance type, key pair, security groups, userdata, etc.).
  - Can version configurations to apply updates easily when launching new instances.
- Auto Scaling Group (ASG):  
  Manages a group of EC2 instances as a logical unit.
  - Uses your launch template to launch or terminate instances as you modify the desired capacity.

4. Steps for Manual Scaling
	
1. Create/Update a Launch Template:
   - Define the instance settings you want for scaling, including AMI, networking, and security.
2. Create an Auto Scaling Group Using the Template:**  
   - The ASG is linked to your launch template and is ready to manage your EC2 instances.
3. Manually Set Desired Capacity:**
   - Use the AWS Management Console, CLI, or API to directly set the desired number of instances.
   - The ASG automatically adds or removes instances to maintain this target, but only in response to your direct actions.

5. Important Notes
- No Scaling Policies:  
  Manual scaling does NOT involve scaling policies, alarms, or automatic triggers. (You can add policies later to convert the setup into dynamic, scheduled, or predictive scaling.)
- Consistency & Speed:  
  Launch templates ensure new instances are configured identically, making manual scaling faster and less error-prone.
- Best For:  
  Use when:
  - You have predictable or static workloads.
  - You want full control over scaling actions.
  - Automation is not required (or not yet ready).

Summary Table

| Component            | Role/Function            | Automation?        | How to Scale         |
|----------------------|-------------------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| Launch Template      | Defines instance config  | No                 | Set once, versioned  |
| Auto Scaling Group   | Manages instance group   | No (manual only)   | Set desired capacity |
| Manual Scaling       | User sets capacity       | No                 | Console, CLI, API    |

Key Points
- Manual scaling provides direct and quick adjustment, but puts the responsibility for capacity management on you.
- Launch templates make manual scaling reliable by preventing misconfigurations.
- For dynamic, scheduled, or predictive scaling, add scaling policies to this configuration later.
