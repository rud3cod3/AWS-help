-----------------------------
* S3 (Simple storage service)
-----------------------------
- We create buckets to store our data
- Maximum file size 5TB
- Provide 99.99999999999% Durability ( chance of data being lost )
- Cannot be used when frequent read write operation are expected
- Higher latency
- Not optimized for frequant data modifications  

----------------
* S3 charges for 
----------------
- Storage
- Requests
- Storage Management
- Data transfer 

-------------------
* Suitable to store
-------------------
- Images | Pdfs | Videos
- Backups and archives
- Static web hosting
- Big data analysis
- Log Storage
- Machine Learning Data Set
- IoT devices data
- Content distribution
- Mobile and gaming application
- Enterprise application

-------------------
* Bucket name rules
-------------------
- Always create bucket nearby your location
- Globally unique
- 3 and 63 characters long
- consist only lowercase, numbers, dots & hyphens (-)
- Must begin and end with a letter or number
- Must not be formatted as ip address

--------------------
* S3 Storage classes
--------------------

(1) Standard
- Frequently accessed date
- More than once a month with miliseconds access
- Expensive, 99.9 Availibility, 99.999999999999 Durability
- Data will be replicated across 3 or more availibility zones
- Dont have to take stress about Min storage, Min object size, Min duration and other consideration
- For every 100GB we are charged 2.5USD/month
- Default one
 
(2) Infrequent Access
- Long-lived infrequent access like once in a month
- Avalibility 99.9, Durability 99.99999999999
- Going to replicate data to 3 or more availibility zone
- Minimum Duration is 30 days (we have to store data atleast for 30 days)
- Minimum File size id 128kb
- For every 100gb we are charged 1.38USD/month
- How ever there are charges on retreval like if you promise to access data only for once and do it more than once they will charge you everytime you access

(3) Intelligent tiering
- Suppose if you dont know wether you are going to access data frequently or infrequently we have this class
- Longlived data with changing or unkown access pattern
- Avalibility 99.9, Durability 99.99999999999
- Minimum Duration is 30 days
- Going to replicate data to 3 or more availibility zone
- For every 100GB we are charged 2.3USD/month
- Here we will have to pay Monitoring and automation fees per object apply.No retrieval fees

(4) ONE ZONE
- For infrequant access
- Its like having backup of on premise servers on s3 cloud
- It is for Recreatable infrequently accessed data  
- Avalibility 99.5 , Durability 99.99999999999
- Stores data in only one availibility zone
- Minimum file size is 128kb
- For every 100GB we are charged 1.25USD/month
- Per GB retrieval fees applies if AZ goes down your access is lost for a particular time range

(5) Express One Zone
- High performance, single-zone storage class
- Lowest latency cloud object storage class available today, with data access speeds up to 10x faster and with request costs 50 precnet lower than S3 standard. 
- We need directory bucket in order to use it 
- At the time of directory bucket creation we have option to choose AZ
- It is like keeping an ec2 instance and s3 bucket in same AZ so there will be less latency
