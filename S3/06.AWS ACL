* AWS ACLs (Access Control Lists)
- Legacy mechanism for managinh permissions on s3 buckets and objects.
- Using this we can grant basic access to specific accounts or predefined groups.
- Can control access at both bucket level and object level.
- Disabled by default and no ACL is attached and permission management through this method.

* Object ownership

1.Bucket owner preferred
- Owner has full access of the bucker
- even if cross account access is enabled and other user can upload their object the owner ship would stay to the bucker owner

2.Object writer
- The one who uploads the object will have full access over the object not the bucket owner 

* ACLs Permission
- Allows you to set permission on who can read or write both the buckets and its contents
- Permission : 

(1) Read (List)		
(2) Write (create, overwrite, delete)		
(3) Read ACL (allow to see ACL permissions)
(4) Write ACL (allow to edit ACL permission)

* ACL is for both bucket and Object
* we can allow cross account access to bucket using "Add grantee"

* Limitations 
- Only offers basic permissions
- Difficult to manage when number of buckets are higher
- Accidental misconfiguration when large group of buckets are there 
- Older way to control permission almost deprecated
