---------------
* Block Storage
---------------

- Think of it like: A filing cabinet full of drawers, and each drawer has folders inside.
- Each folder is a “block” of data.
- The system knows exactly where each block lives and can quickly grab it.
- Good for: Databases or operating systems where you need fast, precise access to small pieces of data.
- Limitation: Not great for massive amounts of unstructured data (like videos or photos) because you have to manage all the “drawers” yourself.


----------------
* Object Storage
----------------
    
- Think of it like: A huge warehouse where every item has a unique label (like a barcode) and you don’t worry about the shelves.
- Each object is stored with its data + metadata (extra info about the object).
- You find things by asking for the label, not by knowing which drawer it’s in.
- Good for: Photos, videos, backups, or logs—basically anything that’s “big and unstructured.”
- Limitation: Slower for very tiny, frequent updates because you can’t just tweak a block—you replace the whole object.

* Why Clouds Prefer Object Storage
----------------------------------
- Scales infinitely: You can just keep adding objects; the “warehouse” grows without worrying about specific drawers.
- Metadata-rich: You can tag objects (date, type, owner) and search easily.
- Durability: Objects are often replicated across multiple locations automatically.
- Cost-effective: Perfect for massive data sets where you don’t need super-fast, random access all the time.
