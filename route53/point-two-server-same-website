- First create a hosted zone, you will get NS and SOA record created automatically
- Now go to create record >> enter record name ( use @ or leave it empty for to keep it same as domain)
- Add ip of web server them *** IMPORTANT *** choose routing policy to "WEIGHTED" and choose "50" in weight
- Choose record id according to preference it is for your understanding >> create record 
- Repeat prcoess twice it will work 

* Something about weight which is mentioned here

limit : [ 0 -255 ]

Example : suppose you have 3 web server

web-server-1 --> Handles 50% traffic --> weight 120
web-server-2 --> Handles 25% traffic --> weight 50
web-server-3 --> Handles 25% traffic --> weight 30

how will we count percentage

create total weight of all of the webserver = 200

so for web-1

120/200 * 100 = 60 %

It is how can find that how to devide traffic between multiple servers
