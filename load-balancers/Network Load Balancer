* Network Load Balancer (NLB) – Layer 4
- Designed for TCP, UDP, and TLS traffic at massive scale with minimal latency.
- Ideal for workloads that require raw network performance or are protocol-agnostic.

* National Security & Defense Systems:
- Many critical systems (e.g., secure VoIP, classified data transfer, sensor data) don’t use HTTP — NLB can route these with near-zero added latency.

* Direct IP handling:
- Preserves client source IP — useful for government intrusion detection systems (IDS) that require packet-level forensics.

* Static IPs & Elastic IPs:
- Some government contracts require fixed public IPs for whitelisting — NLB can bind Elastic IPs for this.

* TLS Termination:
- NLB can terminate TLS with FIPS-compliant ciphers for government-grade encryption compliance.
- Lawful Interception & Monitoring:
- By preserving full packet headers, NLB allows lawful packet capture (pcap) for audit or investigation under government authority.
