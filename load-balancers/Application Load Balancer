1. Application Load Balancer (ALB) â€“ Layer 7

- Primarily for HTTP/HTTPS and gRPC traffic where content-based decisions are needed.
- Enables granular traffic control for application-aware routing.
- Deep Insights for Gov/Interview

* Content filtering & compliance:
- With AWS WAF integration, ALB can be used to enforce government-mandated content policies (e.g., blocking certain domains, enforcing TLS 1.2+ for security compliance like FIPS 140-3).
- Supports mTLS (Mutual TLS) in certain configurations for strict identity verification.

* Routing for multi-agency systems:
- ALB can host multiple government services on one load balancer using host-based routing, which reduces infrastructure cost while isolating data flows logically.

* Logging & Auditing:
- ALB access logs can be pushed to S3 for long-term retention, which is a common requirement in government cyber audit frameworks.

* Security zoning:
- ALB can serve as a boundary device between public internet and internal networks, with security groups and IAM policies controlling access.

* Resilience:
- Multi-AZ design ensures availability in disaster recovery scenarios, essential for mission-critical applications.
