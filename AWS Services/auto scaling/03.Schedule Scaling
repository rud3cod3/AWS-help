* AWS Scheduled Scaling: Complete and Corrected Notes

1.What is Scheduled Scaling?
- Scheduled scaling refers to configuring your Auto Scaling Group (ASG) to automatically change the number of EC2 instances at specific dates and times.
- Useful when you know in advance about predictable changes in application demand, such as weekends, holidays, major sales events (e.g., Big Billion Days), or routine business cycles.
- Use Cases:  
  - Anticipating increased load during planned events.
  - Reducing resources during known low-traffic periods.
  - Automating scaling actions for recurring patterns (e.g., weekly, monthly spikes).

2. How Scheduled Scaling Works
- Pre-requisites:
  - Launch Template: Define all configuration details for your EC2 instances.
  - Auto Scaling Group: Set up ASG using the launch template.
- Configuration Steps:  
  1. Go to your AWS Console and navigate to the Auto Scaling Group.
  2. Access the “Automatic Scaling” section.
  3. Locate Scheduled Actions and add your scaling schedule:
     - Specify the date/time and desired capacity for each action.
     - You can create schedules for both scale-up (increasing instances) and scale-down (decreasing instances).
  4. Save your schedule(s).

- Separate Actions for Scale Up/Down:  
  To handle both scaling up and scaling down at different times, create a separate scheduled action for each intended change.  
  You do not need to create separate ASGs—scheduled scaling is managed within the same group by simply adding multiple schedules.

3. Important Notes
- Predictable Capacity:  
  Scheduled scaling is best when you can forecast group size needs well in advance, minimizing surprises and manual intervention.
- No Metric Triggers:  
  Unlike dynamic scaling, scheduled actions rely strictly on the configured time, not on live metrics or thresholds.
- Flexibility: 
  You can combine scheduled scaling with manual or dynamic policies if needed.

| Feature            | Description                                             | When to Use         | Key Step                                               |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Scheduled Scaling  | Scale up/down at set times                             | Predictable loads   | Add scheduled actions to ASG                           |
| Scale Up           | Increase instance count at planned times               | Events, peak hours  | Create scheduled action for scaling up                 |
| Scale Down         | Decrease instance count at planned times               | Off-peak, weekends  | Create scheduled action for scaling down               |

Key Points
- Scheduled scaling helps automate capacity adjustments ahead of expected demand shifts.
- Configure as many scheduled actions as needed—one per scaling event.
- No extra ASGs are required; all schedules are added directly to your desired ASG.
