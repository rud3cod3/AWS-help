* AWS Predictive Scaling: Complete and Corrected Notes

1. What is Predictive Scaling?
- Predictive Scaling is an advanced feature for EC2 Auto Scaling Groups that uses machine learning to analyze historical traffic patterns and forecast future demand, allowing for proactive scale-out actions.
- Anticipates demand spikes and increases capacity *ahead of time*, rather than waiting for metrics to breach thresholds.
- Ideal for workloads with regular cycles, such as business hours, recurring batch jobs, or planned events.

2.How Predictive Scaling Works
- Data Analysis & Forecasting:  
  - Machine learning models analyze up to 14 days of historical CloudWatch metrics (minimum 24 hours required to generate an initial forecast; more data increases accuracy).[1][2][3][4]
  - Detects daily, weekly, or recurring patterns in workload.
  - Continuously updates forecast every six hours for a rolling 48-hour prediction window.[2][1]
- Scaling Actions:  
  - Predictively adds EC2 instances before forecasted demand spikes—ensures instances are ready to serve traffic.
  - *Only scales out automatically*, does **not** scale in (removes instances) based on predictions—use dynamic scaling policies for scale-in.[5][1][2]
- Modes:  
  - Forecast Only: Generates predictions without taking action (useful for testing and evaluation).
  - Forecast and Scale: Actively launches instances based on forecasted requirements.[1][2]

3. Key Features
- Works With:  
  - Can be combined with dynamic and scheduled scaling—scheduled/dynamic scaling handle real-time metric changes and scale-in, predictive scaling handles proactive scale-out based on forecasts.
- Primary Use Cases:  
  - Applications with cyclical/recurring traffic patterns
  - Workloads that require long initialization times for instances
  - Environments where you want to reduce latency at peak times by provisioning capacity early

4. Required Data
- Historical Data Minimum:  
  - At least 24 hours of metric history to begin forecasting (ideal: 14 days for best accuracy).[8][3][4][1]
- Metrics Used: 
  - Load Metric (proxy for group demand) and Scaling Metric (usage per instance); forecasts are tied to maintaining the Scaling Metric at the target value.

| Feature                  | Description                                   | Requirement               | Limitations         |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| Proactive Scale-Out      | Launch instances ahead of demand              | Min. 24h, ideally 14d data| No scale-in via prediction |
| Forecast Modes           | Forecast Only or Forecast and Scale           | User selection            | Scale-in by dynamic |
| Combines With Other Modes| Works with dynamic/scheduled scaling policies | Optional                  |                     |
| Recurring Patterns       | Best for workloads with predictable cycles    |                           |                     |

Key Points
- Predictive Scaling leverages historical data for proactive capacity planning, helping minimize under-provisioning and performance drops during expected spikes.
- Works best for *predictable* workloads, and should be combined with dynamic policies for unplanned demand and scale-in actions.
- Initial setup requires sufficient metric history; more data yields better forecasts and scaling accuracy.
