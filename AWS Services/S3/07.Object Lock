* S3 Object Lock
- To prevent deletion of an object for the modification of its version for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely.
- Help you to protect your data fron accidental or malicious deletions and modifications.

* Terminology

1. Retention mode 
- Rule that determines how strictly an s3 object version is protected from modification or deletion for a set period of time.

* Governance Mode
- Objects are locked, but users with special permission can change the lock setting or delete he objet
- Policies required to do that : (1) s3:BypassGovernanceRetention	(2) s3:PutObjectRetention

* Compliance Mode
- Objects are locked and cannot be changed or deleted by anyone, including the root account, untill the retention period ends.


2.Retention Period
- Standard duration for which objects will be locked when you enable retention on a bucket.


3.Legal Hold
- Legal holds provides the same protection as a retention period but does not havea predefined expiration date. We can also apply it to a an Object.
- Usefull in scenerios such as in legal investigations when you don't know when the need to retain the data will end.  
- Once enabled cant be disabled only can be suspended


* How to use / where to find ?

- While creating a bucket we can go to Advance setting of this bucket there we will find it
- If the bucket is created already go to peroperties and then find for option named "Object Lock"
- To use object lock "versioning" must be enabled


* Default retention

# When disable
- complete control over which objects have object lock
- we can have varying object lifespan need within object
- flexible to modify or remove protections easily is a priority.

# When enable
- when consistent layer of protection is priority
- Compliance regulations mandate data immutability
- reduce manual configuration
