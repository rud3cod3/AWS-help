---------
Step : 01
---------

First create VPC in one region
- USA-vpc

Then create a subnet 
- 192.168.0.0/24

Launch an ec2-instance

---------
Step : 02
---------

Second VPC creation in the second region
- Mumbai-vpc

Then subnet
-192.168.1.0/24

Launch ec2-instance

---------
Step : 03
---------

Both ec2-instance are in different region, subnet and vpc so they will also dont have public ip

How to connect then ? vpc peering is the answer

now create an Endpoint

VPC >> Endpoints >> Create Endpoint >> EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint 

Choose subnet also security group and other things

click on "Create Endpoitns"

connect ec2 instance using this endpoint/ connect using private ip

---------
Step : 04
---------

Goto any region either of them go to one

Choose peering connection

vpc >>  virtual private cloud(section)  >> peering connection >> create peering connection 

choose requesters vpcid 
then choose whom you want to peer with like same account with vpcs in different region or another account ( in my case same account )
choose the another region (us-east-1 in my case)

Go to the second regions vpc and copy its address and paste in on the requesters side >> then create peering request

---------
Step : 05
---------

Go to second region >> vpc >> peering request 

And accept the peering request 


now to make the communication happen add routing table

go to route table > choose default beacuse thats which being used >  routes > 192.168.1.0/24  and select peering connection and vpc 

do this on both side and boom you have received your ping request 

also one thing i mention to forgot if we want to make both host available for each other we have to create endpoints on both side
