* AWS Custom Termination Policy: Complete Reference

1. Overview
- Custom Termination Policy allows you to fully control which EC2 instances are removed from your Auto Scaling Group (ASG) during scale-in events, rather than relying on preset AWS rules.
- You use AWS Lambda functions or other programmatic logic to create advanced, automated decisions for terminating instances.

2. Why Use a Custom Termination Policy?

Here are five main reasons :

1. Standard Rules May Not Fit Your Needs
   - AWS provides several default termination policies, but complex environments or unique requirements may need more tailored logic.
2. Advanced Checks for Optimal Choice
   - You can incorporate additional checks:
     - Instance tags (terminate by environment, role, or lifecycle)
     - Real-time performance (CPU, memory, network metrics)
     - Custom business logic for compliance or SLA
3. Graceful Shutdown
   - Instead of abrupt termination, your custom policy can ensure:
     - Traffic drains properly
     - In-flight requests complete
     - Notifications sent before termination
4. Backup and Data Protection
   - Before terminating, your custom code can:
     - Back up volumes or state
     - De-register instances from systems (e.g., load balancers)
     - Ensure logs or databases are safely saved
5. Set Any Termination Criteria You Need
   - Terminate based on **your own requirements**, not just age, price, or launch configuration.
   - Example criteria:
     - Least critical service first
     - Instance health status
     - Priority of operational tasks

3. How Custom Termination Policies Work
- Lambda Integration:
  Typically implemented using an AWS Lambda function, triggered during scale-in events.
- Programmable Logic:  
  - Lambda receives the list of candidate instances for termination.
  - Applies your custom selection logic (based on tags, metrics, shutdown steps, backup routines).
  - Returns the instance ID(s) to AWS Auto Scaling for termination.

4.Best Practices
- Ensure Graceful Shutdown:  
  Always account for running workloads, connections, and data.
- Monitor Performance:  
  Use CloudWatch and Lambda logging to track termination success and spot issues.
- Test Thoroughly:  
  Validate your logic in a test environment to avoid accidental removal of critical resources.

5. Summary Table

| Capability                  | Benefit/Example                                 | Typical Use Case                  |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Terminate by tags           | Remove instances by environment or role         | Blue/green deployments            |
| Performance-based selection | Remove least-performant instance                | Cost optimization                 |
| Data backup before removal  | Ensure logs and state are saved                 | Stateful application scaling      |
| Notification integration    | Inform systems or people before termination     | Compliance, support teams         |
| Custom shutdown process     | Run shutdown scripts for graceful exit          | Application migration/upgrades    |

Key Points
- Custom termination policies = full scripting and automation power for safe, efficient, and flexible scale-in.
- Use Lambda to combine AWS data with your own logic and shutdown workflow.
- Ideal for complex environments, data-sensitive apps, or advanced compliance needs.
