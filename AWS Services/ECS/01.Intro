* Monolithic Architecture
- A single, unified codebase/application where all features (UI, business logic, database access, etc.) are tightly coupled and run as one unit

* Microservices Architecture
- Application is split into small, independent services, each responsible for a specific business capability. They communicate via APIs (usually REST or gRPC).
