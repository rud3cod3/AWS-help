* Datasync
- We use Datasync to transfer data from one storage solution to another such as S3 to EFS to SMB to NFS
- On premise to Cloud we use this to move data

* Two option
1. From aws storage service to another service ( S3 to EFS)
2. Onpremise to cloud 
3. We can also use this to copy data from ec2 to another storage service

* first create space in cloud
* download and install datasync ova
* put both machine (one from data need to be copied and datasync vm) in same network
* check in cloud console
* start and look history if everything was done correctly
